# Hackathon

## Installation
Before launching the pipeline, please enter the following commands:
```bash

# 1) To obtain the correct version of snakemake
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
conda activate snakemake
#if "conda activate snakemake" does not work try "conda activate"

# 2) Check if you have the snakemake latest stable version : (should be 5.27.4 or 5.29.0)
snakemake --version

# 3) Download singularity
conda install singularity=3.6.3 -y
#if not working then try :
conda config --set allow_conda_downgrades true
#then try "conda install singularity=3.6.3" again

#4) Check that the launcher file is executable. If not :
chmod 777 launcher.sh

#5) Launch the pipeline
./launcher.sh
#This will install all the remaining necessary tools and launch the pipeline
#BEWARE : see Usage for details !
```
NB : (1) the command sudo apt install snakemake does not give the up-to-date version. Update from that command leads to bugs. (2) sudo apt install singularity corresponds to a game named singularity coded in Python.


## Usage
1. launcher.sh : file with commands necessary to run the pipeline correctly
2. pipeline.smk : file containing all steps (rules) needed to study if there is a differential expression between two types of melanoma samples (4 WT SF3B1, 4 mutated SF3B1).
3. deseq2_annot_visualisation.R : R script run into rule deseq of pipeline.

> All 3 files need to be downloaded in the working directory where the launcher is run.
> The pipeline has been designed to suit any types of machines. We tested the pipeline with option --cores 2. One can adapt the number of cores/CPUs in the launcher pipeline script. 

/!\ BEWARE : Because of a force interaction in rule configure, user has to wait for the job to appear (sra-configuration blue panel will pop-up). Press 'x' key (or ctrl+x if 'x' not sufficient) and the pipeline will continue running automatically.
/!\ BEWARE 2 : the pipeline requires some files to be in the same directory :
- launcher.sh (creation of some necessary empty files, and downloads of dependencies)
- deseq2_annot_visualisation.R (R script called for the analysis in the pipeline)

Estimated execution time of whole pipeline (with default option of --cores 2) : 3,8-4.2 hours
